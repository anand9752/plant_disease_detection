# üöÄ Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Plant Disease Detection System to Streamlit Cloud.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ‚úÖ Required Files
- [x] `app.py` - Main application file (deployment-optimized)
- [x] `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- [x] `class_indices.json` - Disease class mappings
- [x] `disease_info_database.json` - Disease information database
- [x] `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- [x] `.streamlit/secrets.toml` - Secrets template
- [x] `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- [x] `packages.txt` - System dependencies (if needed)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Model Files Strategy

**‚úÖ COMPRESSED MODELS INCLUDED**: This repository includes the compressed TFLite model (45.6MB) directly in the repository for optimal deployment experience.

**Model Loading Priority:**
1. **‚úÖ Compressed TFLite Model** - `compressed_models/dynamic_quantized_model.tflite` (INCLUDED)
2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Original H5 Model** - `trained_model/plant_disease_prediction_model.h5` (EXCLUDED - too large)

**Benefits of this approach:**
- **üöÄ Instant Deployment**: No additional setup required
- **‚ö° Fast Loading**: 91% smaller model size
- **üì± Mobile Ready**: Optimized for all devices
- **üíæ Memory Efficient**: Uses significantly less RAM

**Note**: The original 547MB model is excluded from the repository due to GitHub file size limits, but the compressed 45.6MB TFLite model provides equivalent performance.

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial deployment setup"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Handle Model Files**

   **‚úÖ MODELS INCLUDED**: The compressed model is already included in the repository!
   
   The app will automatically detect and use:
   - `compressed_models/dynamic_quantized_model.tflite` (45.6MB - INCLUDED)
   - Falls back to original model if needed (not included due to size)
   
   **No additional setup required for models!**

### Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. **Access Streamlit Cloud**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Create New App**
   - Click "New app"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select the repository: `yourusername/plant-disease-detection`
   - Set main file path: `app.py`
   - Set branch: `main`

3. **Configure Advanced Settings**
   - Python version: `3.10`
   - Add any environment variables if needed

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy!"
   - Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)

### Step 3: Configure Secrets (if needed)

If your app requires API keys or sensitive configuration:

1. **In Streamlit Cloud Dashboard**
   - Go to your deployed app
   - Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Secrets"
   - Add your secrets in TOML format:
   ```toml
   [general]
   api_key = "your-api-key"
   
   [database]
   connection_string = "your-connection-string"
   ```

## üîß Configuration Details

### Streamlit Configuration (`.streamlit/config.toml`)

```toml
[global]
developmentMode = false
showWarningOnDirectExecution = false

[server]
runOnSave = false
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8501
maxUploadSize = 200
maxMessageSize = 200

[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false

[theme]
primaryColor = "#28a745"
backgroundColor = "#ffffff"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#f8f9fa"
textColor = "#2c3e50"
```

### Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

```txt
# Optimized for deployment with compressed models
numpy==1.24.3
streamlit==1.30.0
tensorflow==2.15.0
Pillow==10.0.1
```

**Removed dependencies:**
- `gdown` - Not needed since models are included in repository
- `requests` - Not needed for model downloading

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Memory Management
- **Model Caching**: Uses `@st.cache_resource` for model loading
- **Data Caching**: Uses `@st.cache_data` for static data
- **Lazy Loading**: Models loaded only when needed
- **Compressed Models**: TFLite reduces memory footprint by 91%

### Streamlit Cloud Limits
- **Memory**: 1GB RAM
- **CPU**: Shared resources
- **Storage**: Limited temporary storage
- **Bandwidth**: Unlimited
- **Concurrent Users**: Up to 1000

### Best Practices
- Use compressed models when possible
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading indicators for better UX
- Optimize image processing
- Cache expensive operations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Model Loading Errors**
```python
# Solution: Add error handling and fallback
try:
    model = load_model()
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Model loading failed: {e}")
    st.info("Please check model file availability")
```

**2. Memory Errors**
```python
# Solution: Use model compression and caching
@st.cache_resource
def load_compressed_model():
    return tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="model.tflite")
```

**3. File Not Found Errors**
```python
# Solution: Check file paths and add existence checks
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    data = load_data(file_path)
else:
    st.error(f"Required file not found: {file_path}")
```

**4. Dependency Issues**
- Ensure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
- Use compatible versions (check Streamlit Cloud docs)
- Test locally before deployment

### Logs and Debugging

**View Logs in Streamlit Cloud:**
1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Click "Manage app"
3. View "Logs" tab for error messages

**Local Testing:**
```bash
# Test the deployment version locally
streamlit run app.py

# Check for import errors
python -c "import streamlit, tensorflow, numpy, PIL"
```

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### Updating Your App

1. **Make Changes Locally**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update feature X"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Automatic Deployment**
   - Streamlit Cloud automatically redeploys on git push
   - Monitor the deployment in the dashboard

### Version Management

**For Model Updates:**
1. Create new GitHub release
2. Upload new model file
3. Update download URL in `app.py`
4. Test deployment

**For Code Updates:**
1. Test locally first
2. Commit and push changes
3. Monitor deployment logs
4. Verify functionality

## üìà Monitoring and Analytics

### Built-in Monitoring
- **Streamlit Cloud Dashboard**: View usage statistics
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor application errors
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and memory usage

### Custom Analytics (Optional)
```python
# Add to app.py for custom tracking
import streamlit.analytics as analytics

# Track user interactions
analytics.track_event("image_upload", {"user_id": "anonymous"})
analytics.track_event("prediction_made", {"confidence": confidence})
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- No user data is stored permanently
- Images are processed in memory only
- No personal information is collected

### Security Best Practices
- Use HTTPS (automatic with Streamlit Cloud)
- Validate file uploads
- Implement input sanitization
- Monitor for unusual usage patterns
